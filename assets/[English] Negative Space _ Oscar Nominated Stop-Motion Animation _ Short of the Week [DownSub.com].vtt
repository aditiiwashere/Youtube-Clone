1
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:19.750
My dad taught me how to pack:

2
00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:22.458
lay out everything.

3
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.125
Put back half.

4
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.333
Roll things that roll.

5
00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:32.963
Wrinkle-prone things

6
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:34.916
on top of cotton things.

7
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.833
Then pants, waist-to-hem.

8
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:42.491
Nooks and crannies for socks.

9
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.458
Belts around the sides like snakes.

10
00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:53.625
Plastic over that.

11
00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:56.583
Then, add shoes.

12
00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.541
Wear heavy stuff.

13
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.250
We started when I was little.

14
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.766
I’d roll up socks.

15
00:01:55.186 --> 00:02:00.125
Then he’d put me in the suitcase.

16
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.791
Some guys bond with their dads

17
00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:00.125
shooting hoops

18
00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:02.250
or talking about Chevrolets.

19
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:06.375
We did it over luggage.

20
00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.256
By the time I was twelve,

21
00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:14.750
if my Dad was busy, I’d pack for him.

22
00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:21.146
Mom tried but didn’t have the knack.

23
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.283
He’d get somewhere for work,

24
00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.541
open his suitcase

25
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.166
and text me

26
00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:45.666
—”Perfect.”

27
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.375
That one word from him meant a lot.

28
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:32.375
The funeral was terrible

29
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.500
—my Dad laid out in that big carton

30
00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:42.140
and me thinking,

31
00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:48.625
Look at all that wasted space.
